      <strong>Hey, Hi and Hello!</strong> I am a 23-year old Computer Science Graduate from
      <strong>{{> link text='IIT Mandi' url='http://iitmandi.ac.in'}}</strong> (living in Hyderabad).
      I am passionate about Web and Mobile Technologies, and also enjoy Football, Puzzles, Action Movies and Pop Music.
      I'm glad you visited my website. Have a look around.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm always looking for ideas that might make my work more creative. In my free time, I read developers' blogs and
      build sotware that is easy to use. I derive inspiration from popular music, and love listening to Internet Radio.
      My professional interests include Software Engineering, Machine Learning, Security and Big Data. And I love Hackathons.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently working at <strong>{{> link text='Microsoft' url='http://microsoft.com'}}</strong> IDC (Hyderabad),
      in <strong>{{> link text='Bing' url='http://bing.com'}}</strong> Entity Experiences, where I build compelling
      user experiences using the Satori Knowledge Graph.
      I am also currently involved in building an open-source framework,
      <strong>{{> link text='HazelWard' url='https://github.com/Abhra1992/hazelward'}}</strong> for NVIDIA CUDA,
      and am looking for contributors for the same.
